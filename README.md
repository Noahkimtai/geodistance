# README

This README would normally document whatever steps are necessary to get the
application up and running.

Things you may want to cover:

* Ruby version

* System dependencies

* Configuration
## Introduction


## Instructions

The React application is in the `client` directory. To set it up, from the root
directory, run:

```console
$ npm install --prefix client
```

Using `--prefix client` will run the npm command within the `client` directory.

To set up your backend, run:

```console
$ bundle install
```

To see how the React application and Rails API are interacting, you can run the
Rails application in one terminal by running:

```console
$ rails s
```

Then, [open another terminal][new terminal] and run React:

```console
$ npm start --prefix client
```

[new terminal]: https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/integrated-terminal#_managing-terminals

Each application will run on its own port on `localhost`:

- React: [http://localhost:4000](http://localhost:4000)
- Rails: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
